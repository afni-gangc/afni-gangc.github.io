## Estimating test-retest reliability for a Stroop dataset

### Preface ###

Properly estimating `test-retest reliability` has become a hot topic in recent years. Traditionally test-retest reliability is usually conceptualized and quantitatively estimated as `intraclass correlation` (ICC), whose definition can be found in, for example, this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraclass_correlation) page. The trational ICC formulation works fine when there is no or little measurement error. However, the adoption of ICC can be problematic when measurement accuracy becomes an issue in situations where the quantity under study is measured many times with substantial amount of variability. 

A new modeling framework is needed to handle measurement errors. In experiments where the effect is assessed through many trials, we need to construct a hierarchical/multilevel model that 1) chacterizes/maps the data structure as close to the data structure (or data generative mechanism) as possible, and 2) separates the cross-trial variability from the estimation process of test-retest reliability. It is this hierarchical modeling framework we would like to adopt and demonstrate in this blog. More detailed theorectical discussion from the modeling perspective can be found in the following papers.

This blog intends to

1) lay out the hierarchical modeling structure;
2) demonstrate the implementation of the hierarhical model using the `R` package `brms` with a dataset from a Stroop experiment from [Hedge et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-017-0935-1).


### Hierarchical modeling framework ###

The modeling framework can be laid as below. Suppose that, in a test-retest experiment, the effect of interest (e.g., reaction time) $y_{crst}$ is measured at trial $t$ ($t=1,2,...,T$) during each of the two repetitions/sessions ($r=1,2$) for subject $s$ ($s=1,2,...,S$) under the condition $c$ ($c=1,2$). If one adopts the conventional ICC formulation, the data would have to be aggregated by collapsing trial dimension and obtain, for example, the average values $\overline{y}_{cs\cdot}$. However, test-retest reliability could be underestimated under some circumstances, and extent of underestimation depends on the relative magnitude of cross-trial variability compared to its cross-subject counterpart (Rouder et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021). Here we build the following hierarchical model:

trial level: $y_{crst}~\sim ~\mathcal D (\mu_{crs},   \sigma^2);$\
subject level: $(\mu_{11s}, \mu_{21s}, \mu_{12s}, \mu_{22s})^T \sim ~\mathcal N(\boldsymbol 0_{4\times 1}, ~\boldsymbol S_{4\times 4}).$

Here the distribution $\mathcal D$ at the trial level can be any probability density that could properly capture the data generataive mechanism. The typical distributions for reaction time are Gaussian, Student's $t$, exponentially-modified Gaussian, (shifted) log-normal, etc. The variance-covariance matrix $\boldsymbol S_{4\times 4}$ captures the inter-relationships among the effects at the subject level. We know that, after scaling, the variance-covariance matrix $\boldsymbol S_{4\times 4}$ would show the correlation structure among the four components of $(\mu_{11s}, \mu_{21s}, \mu_{12s}, \mu_{22s})$. Later I will demonstrate how to extract the jewels in the crown from this matrix $\boldsymbol S_{4\times 4}$. 


I'd like to note the following few aspects-

The crucial aspect of the hierachical model above is that

(I wish that the model could be expressed more elegantly using vector-matrix formulation, but the math notation support at gihub is quite limited at the moment.)


$$(\sigma_{11s}, \sigma_{21s}, \sigma_{12s}, \sigma_{22s})^T \sim ~\mathcal N(\boldsymbol 0_{4\times 1}, \boldsymbol S_{4\times 4})$$

$$(y_{1st}, ~y_{2st})^T ~\sim ~\mathcal D ((\mu_{c_1 r_1s},  \mu_{2s})^T, \Sigma_{2\times 2})$$
$$(\mu_{1s}, ~y_{2st})^T ~\sim ~\mathcal D ( $$
